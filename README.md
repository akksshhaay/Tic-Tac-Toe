# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe game using Minimax Algorithm with Alpha and Beta Pruning

In this project, the core functionalities of the application are:
1) Initialize the board.
2) To update the board after each move.
3) To make a move after the opponents move (if it’s a 1-Player game) using Minimax Algorithm.
4) To check whether anyone is winning or not?
5) To check the game is over or not?
6) Minimax Algorithm for predicting the next move.

The input to the application is the Tic-Tac-Toe Game Board and the status of the Checkbox (Whether the AI is ON or OFF). The game will continue till the maximum of a total of 9 moves of both the players turn by turn. The output of the application will be the winner of the game. In Between of the gameplay, if any player has three wining back to back forks on the game board then the application will declare that player as a winner and game will be terminated. Also, the application will keep track of how many games the player with fork ‘X’ and player with fork ‘O’ won.
